## üóÇÔ∏è Issues Details

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Type: ContentLoss

**Description:**  
The main headline text (e.g., 'Sing along to every song : priceless') is truncated on the left side, with part of the text being cut off and not visible.

**Suggestion:**  
Ensure text containers use flexible units (e.g., percentages, `em`, `rem`, `vw`) and allow for content to wrap or scale down gracefully when text size is increased. Avoid fixed-width containers that do not account for text enlargement.


---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Type: ContentLoss

**Description:**  
The descriptive text below the headline (e.g., 'Unformed concert tickets and more') is truncated on the left side, with part of the text being cut off and not visible.

**Suggestion:**  
Implement a more robust responsive design that accommodates text resizing. Use relative units for widths and padding, and consider `min-width` or `max-width` properties along with `word-wrap: break-word` or similar for long strings to prevent truncation.
