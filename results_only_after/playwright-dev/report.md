## üóÇÔ∏è Issues Details

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Type: ContentLoss

**Description:**  
Significant portions of the main heading text (e.g., 'Playwright', 'enables', 'reliable', 'end-to-end', 'testing', 'modern') are truncated horizontally, making them unreadable without horizontal scrolling.

**Suggestion:**  
Ensure text containers use relative units (e.g., em, rem, %) for width and font-size, and allow text to wrap to new lines. Implement flexible layouts (e.g., Flexbox, Grid) that adapt to increased text size without truncation.


---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Type: HorizontalScroll

**Description:**  
Horizontal scrolling is introduced to view the full main heading text due to lines being truncated rather than wrapping, violating the 200% text zoom requirement.

**Suggestion:**  
Design the layout to be fluid and allow text to wrap naturally when font size increases, avoiding fixed-width containers that force horizontal overflow. Use CSS properties like `word-wrap: break-word` or `overflow-wrap: break-word` if necessary.
