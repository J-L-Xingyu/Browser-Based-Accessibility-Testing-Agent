## üóÇÔ∏è Issues Details

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Type: OverlappingElements

**Description:**  
In the top header, the navigation links 'Premium', 'Support', and 'Download' overlap each other, and the 'Sign up' and 'Log in' buttons are pushed out of view, becoming inaccessible.

**Suggestion:**  
Implement a responsive header that allows items to wrap or collapses them into a hamburger-style menu at larger text sizes to ensure all navigation options remain visible and usable.


---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Type: ContentLoss

**Description:**  
In the 'Create your first playlist' section on the left, the descriptive text is cut off horizontally because its container has a fixed height and does not expand with the content.

**Suggestion:**  
Allow containers holding text to expand vertically as text size increases. Use 'min-height' instead of a fixed 'height' property or allow the height to be determined by the content within.
